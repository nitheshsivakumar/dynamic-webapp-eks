Kubernetes-based Deployment on AWS with Amazon EKS

## üìå Project Overview

This project deploys the **RentZone car rental application** on **AWS using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** for scalable, containerized workloads. It leverages, **Amazon ECR for container storage**, and **EKS for Kubernetes-based orchestration**. 

## üéØ Problem Solved

- **Scalability & High Availability**: Used **Amazon EKS** to efficiently manage containerized workloads.
- **Automated Infrastructure Provisioning**: Defined infrastructure using **Terraform**.
- **Efficient Deployment & Load Balancing**: Managed Kubernetes workloads with **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**.
- **Security & Access Control**: Used **IAM roles, security groups, and Secrets Manager**.
- **Database Reliability**: Deployed **Amazon RDS (MySQL) with Multi-AZ** for fault tolerance.
